### Severe
* Getting two horizontal matches, one above the other, in a single move causes the gravity animation to not play properly.

### Less Severe
* You can make a match while tiles are falling elsewhere, but it can cause a race condition that results in rendering errors.

* Making a move while tiles are falling sometimes results in cascades not processing.
